@[JvmInline](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.jvm/-jvm-inline/index.html)

value class [BinaryOutput](index.md) : [Closeable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html), [Flushable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Flushable.html)

A binary stream with functions for writing primitives or classes with a [protocolOf](../protocol-of.md) in Kanary format. Does not support marking. Calling [close](close.md) also closes the underlying stream. This object does not need to be closed so long as the underlying stream is closed.
